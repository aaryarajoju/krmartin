## Run it for yourself

Prerequisites: [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)), and your bot's token.

Fork [the repository](https://github.com/aaryarajoju/AR50), and then clone it to your local device. <br>
In that directory, install [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/#/) with the command `npm install discord.js`. <br>
And then, add a file called `config.json` in the same directory, which should contain the following code:

````json
{
    "token": "<the bot token>",
}
````

For running the program, use the command `node index.js` in the same directory.
